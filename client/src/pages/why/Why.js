          Amidst this crazy job market, I wanted to work on a project that will
          help job seekers practise on basic fundamentals which will help them
          during their interviews. As someone who is currently unemployed, I
          thought this project idea will benefit both the people searching for
          jobs and myself.
        </p>
        <div className="updates">
          <h1>Future updates</h1>
          <p>
            I plan on adding more topics that do not focus only on computer
            science fundamentals, and will include other topics from different
            subjects
